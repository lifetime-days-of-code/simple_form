  <!-- NOTE--1.3 From semantic point of view the form element tells certain engines and assistive technologies that a input form is about to start, a form with possible multiple elements. Also it links the button to the form.-->
  <!--! NOTE--1.4 The 'action' attribute allows you to define the URL, the path, this request should be sent to. By default it sends this request to the same URL that was used for serving this page. Very often you want to send data inputted from the user to a different URL. You can add as example a relative path as /user-data. To use the same domain but with different path.-->
  <!--! NOTE--1.5 The 'method' allows us to chose the type of HTTP request that should be used to submit the form.The type of request that should be send to the server. GET / POST. Typically in forms we are using POST methods. -->
  <!-- <form action="/user-data" method="POST"> -->
  <form action="/" method="GET">
    <!-- NOTE--1.0 Always add the type of the input element even if its the default text. -->
    <!-- NOTE--1.1 The default display property for both input field and button elements is inline-block. Which means they will be inline unless there is not enough space for both of them. -->
    <!--! NOTE--1.6 The 'name' attribute is very important if we wanna make sure that any data that is submitted trough the form like here in this input element is passed along with the request.The 'name' attribute allows you to add a unique identifier to this input element. Just as we can do with 'id' but 'id' just won't work for form submission. Instead here we will need a special name attribute which we can specify in addition to the 'id'. We need to use POST request, to have 'name' attribute in the input field with unique identifier  and 'action' attribute in the form with url path in order to see the data the request payload in the dev tools network tab -->
    <!-- <input type="text" name="user-name"> -->
    <!--! NOTE--1.7  If we change the form request method to GET amd tje action path to refer to the main page of this server which by default is the index.html. In that case you will find the data submitted trough the form in the payload as a query string parameter. Also you can see it append to the URL after a '?' mark-->
    <!-- <input type="text" name="user-name"> -->
    <!--We can/should give our label the special attribute 'for'. With it we kind of connect this label to an input. We need to give that input and "id" and refer to it trough the 'for' attribute. -->
    <label for="username">Your name</label>
    <input type="text" name="user-name" id="username">
    <label for="useremail">Your email address</label>
    <input type="email" name="user-email" id="useremail">
    <label for="userage">Your age</label>
    <!--! NOTE--2.0 'step' attribute is for telling the input field of type number with how much to increment or decrement its value -->
    <input type="number" step="2" name="user-age" id="userage">
    <label for="userpassword">Your password</label>
    <input type="password" name="user-password" id="userpassword">
    <label for="userbirthday">Your birthday</label>
    <input type="date" name='user-birthday' id="userbirthday">
    <hr>
    <h2>How should we verify your account?</h2>
    <!--! NOTE--2.1 To ensure the browser forces the user to chose one of those option is important to give all the inputs the same 'name' -->
    <!--! NOTE--2.2 We use the 'value' attribute to give a value that is submitted to the server when one of those input is picked. Short meaningful identifiers. We can use the value to add default inputs to input text fields for example. -->
    <div class="form-control-inline">
      <input type="radio" name="verify" id="verify-text" value="text-message">
      <label for="verify-text">Via text message(SMS)</label>

    <div class="form-control-inline">
      <input type="radio" name="verify" id="verify-phone" value="phone">

      <label for="verify-email">Via email</label>
    </div>
    <!--! NOTE--2.3 Here the returned value is 'on' in case of the checkbox being checked or no value at all in case if its NOT.-->
    <div class="form-control-inline">
      <input type="checkbox" name="terms" id="agree-terms">
      <label for="agree-terms">Agree to terms?</label>
    </div>
    <!--! NOTE--2.4 With type 'checkbox' when we gave two or more checkboxes the same name, We will be able to select multiple values, but they will be  grouped together when they are send to the server on submit. In case we are grouping two or more checkboxes we should give them a 'value' attribute with identifiers which we can extract on the server later on. We DON'T NEED to specify value if there is only one checkbox because it will return only on or no value at all.-->
    <div class="form-control-inline">
      <input type="checkbox" name="contact" id="contact-email" value="email">
      <label for="contact-email">Contact me via email</label>

    <label for="favorite-color">Your favorite color</label>
    <select name="favorite-color" id="favorite-color">
      <!--NOTE--3.0: usually the default value to option which is submitted is the value that is between the option open and closing tag.If we want to send to the server different value we should specified it explicitly with the value attribute -->
      <option value="blue">My favorite color is Blue</option>
      <option value="black">My favorite color is Black</option>
      <option value="red">My favorite color is Red</option>
    </select>
    <button>Submit</button>
  </form>
  <!--! NOTE--1.8 A difference between GET and POST request. For POST requests any data that is submitted will be part of the request itself. It's kind of a some metadata that's attached to it. For GET requests, the primary idea is not to submit data, and therefore its not encoded in the request, but instead its added to into the URL.By adding a question mark and then key value pairs, where the keys are the identifiers you chose on form elements and the values are the pieces of data that have been entered. And if you haver multiple form elements, these key value pair elements would be separated by '&'' '?key=value&key=value&key=value' -->
